#Data: `example_lambda.conv.fits`

This example simulates the Halpha emission-line (rest frame 6562.68 AA) of galaxy at z = 0.0018.
The pixel size of the simulated cube is 0.4 arcsec*pixel**-1.
The channel width is 2AA ~ 57 km/s 
The data has been spatially convolved by 2.5arcsec@FWHM and spectrally convolved by 3AA@FWHM.

Halpha intensity and velocity dispersion follows a Sersic profile (n=1)
Rotational curve reaches Vmax~280 km/s.
Vrad = 30 km/s --> radial noncircular flow up to 10arcsec
Vtan = 50 km/s --> tangential noncircular flow up to 10arcsec
Bar angle on the galaxy plane PHI_BAR = 30

# USE of XS3D. Type XS3D in a terminal. You will get the following:
 
USE: XS3D name cube.fits [mask2D] PA INC X0 Y0 [VSYS] vary_PA vary_INC vary_X0 vary_Y0 vary_VSYS ring_space [delta] Rstart,Rfinal cover kin_model [R_bar_min,R_bar_max] [config_file] [prefix]
 

#Setup,
In this example we will estimate the rotation curves in raddi equali spaced.
The starting ring (`Rstart`) will be placed at 1 arcsec, and subsequent rings will be placed each 2 arcsec (`ring_space`).
The maximum radius (`Rfinal`)will be placed up to 40 arcsec (on the disk plane).
- Velocities will be computed in each ring only if rings contain at least 1/3 of the total pixels contained in a ring, (`cover` = 1/3).
- Noncircular motions describing the bar distortion will be computed up to 10 arcsec (`R_bar_max`=10).
- It will be used the Levenbergâ€“Marquardt (LM) for the least-square analysis

- PA[deg] = 15, INC[deg] = 35, X0[pixels] = 75.1, Y0[pixels] = 75.1 are the initial guess values for the disk geometry.
For this example all parameters are not allowed to vary during the fitting (i.e, VARY_PARAM = 0)
- The starting systemic velocity VSYS[km/s] is estimated around the kinematic centre (X0,Y0)

############################
# XS3D configuration file  # 
############################

The XS3D configuration file is designed to pass informations about the PSF and LSF, as well as to
set-up the errors via bootstrap.
This information is needed to convolve the model at the obserational spatial and spectral resolutions.
This file is passed in command line, for this example it takes the name as `xs_conf_lambda.ini`, which has been
configured in advance.


***By default XS3D ALWAYS use the config file stored in ./src0/xs_config.ini, where all variables are deactivated by default.***
 
It is recomended that you copy the xs_config.ini file in your working directory and edit it accordingly.

#Data: `example_freq.conv.fits`

This example simulates the HI emission (rest frame 1420405752 Hz) of galaxy at z = 0.0018.
The pixel size of the simulated cube is 0.4 arcsec*pixel**-1.
The channel width is 24414.0625 Hz ~ 5 km/s 
The data has been spatially convolved by 2.5arcsec@FWHM and spectrally convolved by 10 km/s.

The intrinsic dispersion has been set to a constant value of 20 km/s.
The rotation curve grows slowly from 0 km/s @ 0 arsec to 150 km/s @ 40arcsec

- PA[deg] = 330, INC[deg] = 50, X0[pixels] = 75.1, Y0[pixels] = 75.1 are the initial guess values for the disk geometry.
