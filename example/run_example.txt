Example of running XookSuut3D on a simulated datacube with an oval distortion in the center.

#Goal:
Recover the different kinemaitc components from each kinematic model.

#Data: `califa.conv.fits`
This example simulates the Halpha emission-line (rest frame 6562.68 AA).
The pixel size of the simulated cube is 0.4 arcsec*pixel**-1.
The data has been spatial (2.5arcsec@FWHM) and spectral (2AA@FWHM) convolved.

Halpha intensity follows a Sersic profile (n=1)
Rotational curve reaches Vmax~280 km/s.
Vrad = 30 km/s --> radial noncircular flow up to 10arcsec
Vtan = 50 km/s --> tangential noncircular flow up to 10arcsec
Bar angle on the galaxy PHI_BAR = 30
vsys = 4900 km/s

# USE of XS3D. Type XS3D in a terminal. You will get the following:
 
USE: XS3D name cube.fits [error_map.fits,SN] PA INC X0 Y0 [VSYS] vary_PA vary_INC vary_X0 vary_Y0 vary_VSYS ring_space [delta] Rstart,Rfinal cover kin_model [R_bar_min,R_bar_max] [config_file] [prefix]
 

#Setup,
In this example we will estimate the rotation curves in raddi equali spaced.
The starting ring (`Rstart`) will be placed at 1 arcsec, and subsequent rings will be placed each 2 arcsec (`ring_space`).
The maximum radius (`Rfinal`)will be placed up to 40 arcsec (on the disk plane).
- Velocities will be computed in each ring only if rings contain at least 1/3 of the total pixels contained in a ring, (`cover` = 1/3).
- Noncircular motions describing the bar distortion will be computed up to 11 arcsec (`R_bar_max`=11).
- It will be used the Levenbergâ€“Marquardt (LM) for the least-square analysis

- PA[deg] = 15, INC[deg] = 35, X0[pixels] = 50.1, Y0[pixels] = 50.1 are the initial guess values for the disk geometry.
For this example all parameters are not allowed to vary during the fitting (i.e, VARY_PARAM = 0)
- The starting systemic velocity VSYS[km/s] is estimated around the kinematic centre (X0,Y0)

############################
# XS3D configuration file  # 
############################

The XS3D configuration file is designed to pass informations about the PSF and LSF, as well as to
set-up the errors via bootstrap.
This information is needed to convolve the model at the obserational spatial and spectral resolutions.
This file is passed in command line, for this example it takes the name as `xs_califa.ini`, which has been
configured in advance.


***By default XS3D ALWAYS uses the config file stored in ./src0/xs_config.ini, where all variables are deactivated by default.***
 
It is recomended that you copy the xs_config.ini file in your working directory and edit it accordingly.
